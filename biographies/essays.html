      <h1>Esperanza Rising</h1>
      <p>
        Many people want to learn about the elements of literature, so they get familiar with the elements of
        literature. Pam Munoz Ryan wrote a lot of books and all of them are beautiful. She started writing books in the
        late 1990’s and early 2000’s. Pam Munoz Ryan writes historical fiction which is history combined with fiction.
        In Esperanza Rising, the author uses many elements of literature such as direct and indirect characterization,
        and settings to how the story moves along.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first element of literature that will be discussed is indirect characterization. On page 116 “In her entire
        life, Esperanza had never held a broom in her hand”. This shows that she had never swept and always had someone
        to come and clean up after her. It might make the reader think that she is trying to learn new things. Finally,
        Esperanza changes through the story through indirect characterization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second element of literature that will be discussed is direct characterization. On page 28 and top of page
        29 “At first, they only stayed a few hours, but soon they became like the pumpkin, the squash plant in Alfonso’s
        garden, whose giant leaves spread out, encroaching on anything smaller”. This shows that they are probably not
        coming over to watch them, but they want to take something. The reader might feel that they are trying to do
        something that will hurt Esperanza and Mama. Finally, direct characterization shows that Tio Luis and Tio Marcos
        are not good characters because they are trying to hurt Esperanza and Mama.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final element of literature that will be discussed is settings. On page 99 “Beyond those trees is a Mexican
        camp” said Isabel “where we live”. This shows that they probably don’t have a proper home and that they are very
        poor. The reader might feel that they are poor, they might not have a lot of food, and they don’t have a proper
        place to live. Finally, the setting establishes where they live, the conditions they live in, and reveals more
        about the characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, in Esperanza Rising the author uses many elements of literature such as indirect
        characterization, direct characterization, and settings to show how the story moves along. Esperanza changes
        through the story with indirect characterization. Through direct characterization we learn Tio Luis and Tio
        Marcos are not good characters as they are trying to hurt Esperanza and Mama. The setting establishes where they
        live, the conditions they live in, and reveals more about the characters.
